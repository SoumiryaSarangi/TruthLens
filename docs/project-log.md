# TruthLens — project log

**Read this first in any new session.** It is the running record of what has
been built, what was decided and why, and what is next. When the context
window is compacted, this file is what carries the project forward.

Append to it; do not rewrite history. Every entry is dated. If a decision is
reversed, add a new entry saying so rather than editing the old one — the
reasoning that turned out wrong is still evidence.

**Related files:** `CLAUDE.md` (rules and conventions) · `docs/specs/` (PRD,
SRS, SYSTEM_DESIGN, UI_UX — what is being built) · `docs/phase-plan.md` (where
we are in the phase order) · `docs/build-plan.md` (historical rationale) ·
`docs/data-profile.md` (generated counts) · `docs/results.md` (generated
results tables) · `docs/environment.md` (toolchain).

**Precedence when they disagree:** code and tests > `CLAUDE.md` > `docs/specs/`
> `docs/build-plan.md`.

## Status at a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Current phase** | Phase 0 complete; data acquired; specs written. Phase 1 not started. |
| **Clock** | 14 days. Day 1 = first day of Phase 1, which has not begun. Freeze end of Day 12. |
| **Hardware** | i7-14700HX + RTX 4050 laptop GPU, 6 GB VRAM. No Colab. |
| **Branch model** | Trunk-based. Everything commits straight to `main`. |
| **Python** | 3.11.16 via uv, in `.venv`. System Python is 3.13 and is not used. |
| **Tests** | 83 passing, 1 skipped |
| **Datasets in hand** | AVeriTeC, X-CLAIM |
| **Datasets waiting** | MultiClaim (access requested), CheckThat! 2025 T2 (not started) |
| **Models trained** | None. No model code exists yet — this is deliberate. |

## 2026-09-20 — Phase 0: the harness, before any model

**Why first.** The dominant failure mode in agent-assisted ML is not broken
code, it is plausible code that runs, produces a number, and is silently
wrong. Phase 0 builds the thing that catches that.

### Built

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Eval harness | `src/eval/evaluate.py` — predictions JSONL + config YAML → `results/{config_hash}.json` |
| Metrics | `src/eval/metrics.py` — pure functions, cross-checked against scikit-learn |
| Dumb baselines | `src/eval/baselines.py` — generate predictions, so they travel the same path a model does |
| Leakage detection | `src/data/leakage.py` — 4 checks |
| Frozen splits | `data/splits/` + `SPLITS.lock`, enforced in four places |
| Results tables | `src/eval/report.py` → `docs/results.md` |
| CI | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint, tests, leakage, end-to-end eval |

### Five guardrails, each enforcing a rule already in CLAUDE.md

1. `baseline:` is mandatory — no baseline, no results file
2. a `test` split aborts unless `TRUTHLENS_ALLOW_TEST=1`
3. a split disagreeing with `SPLITS.lock` aborts
4. a metric above `sanity_ceiling` writes a loud warning
5. duplicate / unknown / missing uids abort unless `allow_partial`

### Decisions and why

- **Splits are ID manifests, not text.** Keeps the repo publishable without
  redistributing licensed data. Near-duplicate detection still works in CI via
  a 64-bit SimHash stored in the manifest (16 hex chars per row).
- **SimHash thresholds were calibrated, not assumed.** Measured on this
  project's own text: trivial variants 0–4 Hamming, word substitutions ~10,
  unrelated claims 22+. Fail at 8, warn at 14.
- **Stated limitation:** this catches duplicates and trivial variants, *not*
  semantic paraphrase. Embedding-based detection belongs in Phase 4.
- **Trunk-based git.** Phase branches were ceremony on a solo repo; a two-week
  branch is deferred integration, not isolation.

### Bugs the tests caught in the harness itself

Lock keys written as absolute paths (unusable in CI); the split parsed before
its integrity was checked (tampering surfaced as a confusing JSON error); a
bad label crashed instead of refusing; `.gitattributes` had the catch-all `*`
last, where it silently overrode every `-text` protection on the frozen splits.

## 2026-09-20 — Verdict scheme widened to 5 classes

`Supported / Refuted / Conflicting / NEI / NotAClaim`.

AVeriTeC ships `Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking`, which the old 4-class
scheme had nowhere to put. The alternative was collapsing it into NEI, which
throws away a distinction AVeriTeC paid annotators to make and makes NEI mean
two different things at once.

Mapping is in `src/data/labels.py`. `verdict_4class` was **removed**, not kept
as an alias — two competing schemes is exactly how a label set rots.

**Two consequences to state in the report, not discover in the viva:**

- `NotAClaim` has zero support on AVeriTeC-only runs (AVeriTeC claims are all
  already claims), so macro-F1 there is **structurally capped at 0.80**.
- `Conflicting` is rare (~7%). Read its per-class F1 next to its support.

## 2026-09-20 — Data acquisition: AVeriTeC and X-CLAIM

`make data` — fetch, build splits, profile, check. Sources and the sha256 of
every file are in `data/raw/DOWNLOADS.json`.

### What landed

| Dataset | train | dev | test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| averitec | 2666 | 500 | 307 |
| x_claim | 5343 | 600 | 571 |

X-CLAIM raw counts matched the paper exactly (EN 3891/400/371, HI 1193/100/100,
PA 346/100/100) before dedup — a good sign the loader is reading it right.

### Decisions and why

- **AVeriTeC's test split is withheld** for the FEVER shared task. Held out
  10% of the public train, stratified by label, seed 42, as a local test set.
  The official dev split is used unchanged so dev numbers stay comparable to
  published work. Our train is correspondingly smaller than the official one.
- **`en2xx` X-CLAIM files deliberately not downloaded.** They are machine
  translated; X-CLAIM's own finding is that joint multilingual training beats
  English-translated training, and mixing them in would undermine that
  ablation.
- **Freeze now means committed, not merely written.** A split file git has
  never seen is still being built and can be overwritten freely. Requiring the
  full override ceremony for those would only teach the habit of reaching for
  the override.

### The leakage test failed on real data — as designed

First run: **49 failures in AVeriTeC, 55 in X-CLAIM.** Root cause, diagnosed
against the raw files:

| Source of overlap | Count |
| --- | --- |
| AVeriTeC official `train.json` internal duplicates | 71 (2997 unique of 3068) |
| AVeriTeC official `train` ∩ `dev` | 4 — **upstream** |
| X-CLAIM `en` train∩dev / train∩test | 3 / 2 — **upstream** |
| X-CLAIM cross-language (same post in `pa` and `hi` files) | 2 |

This is the DS@GT CheckThat! 2025 finding reproduced, and it is a reportable
result rather than a bug.

**Policy adopted: train yields to eval.** Drop the offending row from *train*,
never from dev/test — shrinking an eval split silently changes the benchmark
and makes our numbers incomparable with published ones. Dropped 94 train rows
from AVeriTeC, 87 from X-CLAIM. Dev and test were not modified at all.

**Two X-CLAIM dev↔test pairs are irreducible** (Jaccard 0.906, 0.990); both
sides are official eval splits. Accepted by exact uid pair in
`data/splits/KNOWN_LEAKAGE.json` with a written reason. Anything not on that
list still fails. Bounds dev→test contamination at 2/571 = **0.35%**.

### Two findings worth carrying into every later phase

1. **The AVeriTeC majority-class baseline is 58–61% accuracy** — *higher* than
   the ~50% figure the build plan cites as competitive SOTA. Accuracy is
   therefore close to useless on this data; always-predict-Refuted beats
   published systems on it. **Macro-F1 is the metric that means something**,
   and every accuracy number must be shown next to the majority baseline.
2. **Punjabi is 26.5% non-native script in X-CLAIM train.** The language
   column is not the script column: `train-pa.csv` holds 249 Gurmukhi, 54
   Devanagari and 36 Latin rows. Script is detected per row
   (`src/data/script_id.py`) and never inferred from the filename.

## 2026-09-21 — Specs added; 14-day timeline; hardware settled

Four specification documents landed in `docs/specs/`. This entry records what
they own, what changed around them, and every place they disagreed with the code.

### What each document owns

| Document | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRD.md` | Why and for whom: problem, users, scenarios, scope priorities, success bars | Testable requirements |
| `SRS.md` | Numbered requirements (FR-1…FR-27, NFR-1…NFR-12), each with a verification method | Why they exist; how they are built |
| `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` | Stage contracts, data models, API schema, GPU budget, failure handling | Requirements; screens |
| `UI_UX.md` | Screens, states, verdict card, copy, accessibility, demo script | Response fields |

**Precedence, now written into `CLAUDE.md`:** code and tests > `CLAUDE.md` >
`docs/specs/` > `docs/build-plan.md`. The build plan is reclassified as
historical rationale and carries a header note saying so. Its embedded copy of
an older `CLAUDE.md` and its session starter prompts still describe the 4-class
scheme; they are left as written rather than back-dated.

### Timeline and hardware

13 weeks became **14 days**, Day 1 = the first day of Phase 1. Phase 1 Day 1 ·
Phase 2 Days 2-3 · Phase 3 Day 4 · Phase 4 Days 5-6 · Phase 5 Days 7-8 ·
Phase 6 Days 9-11 · Phase 7 Days 12-14, **code freeze end of Day 12**.

Added rule: **if MultiClaim is not approved by Day 5, swap Phases 4 and 5** and
do evidence retrieval first. The fast path is reordered, never cut.

Hardware settled: **i7-14700HX + RTX 4050 laptop GPU, 6 GB VRAM, no Colab.**
That closes the build plan's open "Compute" question and fixes the model sizes:
XLM-R-base not large, LoRA throughout, fp16, one training job at a time.

### Phase 6 generator: IndicBART, decided

Was "mT5 or IndicBART". Now IndicBART, for two reasons in order: it fits
(244M, ~0.5 GB fp16, inside a 5.5 GB inference ceiling alongside ~2.3 GB of
other resident weights), and it is an encoder-decoder, so the Unit IV
seq2seq-with-attention requirement is satisfied by attention over the actual
evidence passages rather than by a figure that means nothing.

**Considered and rejected: a modern small instruction-tuned model** (Qwen2.5-3B
via QLoRA). It would likely produce more fluent Hindi explanations and would
physically fit at 4-bit. Rejected **to protect the timeline, not on quality** —
a new quantisation and adapter stack on day 9 of 14 can eat two days and return
a model that generates beautifully and cites nothing.

If Days 9-11 have slack, spend it on a **prompted-LLM comparison** rather than
on mT5-small. It answers the obvious viva question ("why not just prompt an
LLM?") with a number instead of an opinion.

### Conflicts found, and how each was resolved

Spec vs code — the code won every time, per the precedence rule:

| Conflict | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `Script` Literal included `"mixed"`, and FR-4 claimed `script_id.py` detects it. It does not — `detect_script()` returns `deva`/`guru`/`latn` only | Dropped `"mixed"`. Added `script_purity: float` to `Preprocessed`, reusing the existing `script_id.script_purity()`. A fourth enum value would have created a new per-script cell and changed the native-vs-romanized table |
| `Lang` includes `"other"`; `splits.py LANGS` does not | Not a real conflict — `other` is runtime-only, never a split row. Stated explicitly so nobody "fixes" the split schema to match |
| `SYSTEM_DESIGN` §13 presented `make index` and `make serve` as existing | Marked both new-in-Phase-1. `make setup-ml` does exist |

Spec vs spec:

| Conflict | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `UI_UX` §7 requires the confidence-band cut points from `/version` and forbids hard-coding them; `SYSTEM_DESIGN` §8 and FR-21 both omitted them, leaving the UI no legal source | Added `confidence_bands: {high, medium}` to the `/version` payload and to FR-21 |
| The abstain → template-explanation rule was in `SYSTEM_DESIGN` §2 prose and the diagram, but missing from §11's failure table where every other degradation rule lives | Added the row to §11 |

Docs vs reality:

| Conflict | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `environment.md` said to install the **CPU** torch build | Corrected to the CUDA build, with a verification snippet and an instruction to record the resolved build string. A CPU wheel installs silently and trains ~20x slower — on 14 days that is most of the project |
| `phase-plan.md` said loaders were not started, splits had no data, and the AVeriTeC label mapping was undecided | All four were done. Rewritten |
| `build-plan.md` Phase 1 and its results-log row still said 4-class | Both now 5-class |

### Carried forward as open questions

- **`mixed` as a fourth script value** — decided against for now (it would change
  the harness breakdown vocabulary), but it is a product question as much as a
  technical one and can be revisited in Phase 2.
- **No transliteration package is pinned.** `CLAUDE.md` promises IndicXlit;
  `requirements-ml.txt` contains nothing that can transliterate. FR-5 is P0 and
  all of Phase 2 depends on it. The Day-2 install spike is scheduled, but the
  lock needs an entry either way.
- **`requirements-ml.in` still has Colab comments** (`peft ... free-tier Colab
  contingency`). Cosmetic, left alone in a docs-only change.


## Next

**Phase 1 — vertical slice, English only. This is Day 1;** the 14-day clock
starts when it does. AVeriTeC dev → BM25 over its knowledge store →
off-the-shelf NLI for a 5-class verdict → template explanation with source
links → FastAPI `POST /verify` → one plain HTML page. Ugly, working,
committed. Its numbers are the floor everything else must beat.

Contracts and module layout: `docs/specs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` §4–5. Requirements:
`docs/specs/SRS.md`. Do not re-derive either.

Before starting it: `make setup-ml`, then install the **CUDA** torch build for
the RTX 4050 and verify `torch.cuda.is_available()` — see
`docs/environment.md`. A CPU wheel installs silently and costs most of the
timeline.

### Open items

- **MultiClaim** — access requested on Zenodo, awaiting approval. When it
  lands: add a `SOURCES` entry in `scripts/download_data.py`, a loader in
  `src/data/loaders.py`, then `make data`.
- **CheckThat! 2025 Task 2** — not started; needed for Phase 3.
- **AVeriTeC knowledge store** — only claims are downloaded. The evidence
  store is ~1000 articles × 4568 claims; ~109 GB free here, so check size and
  plan on a subset. **Phase 1 is blocked on this.**
- **No transliteration package is pinned** in `requirements-ml.txt`, though
  `CLAUDE.md` promises IndicXlit and FR-5 is P0. Day-2 install spike is
  scheduled; the lock needs an entry either way.
- **MultiClaim swap rule** — if access is not granted by **Day 5**, swap
  Phases 4 and 5 and do evidence retrieval first.
- ~~CI has never been observed green.~~ **Resolved 2026-09-21: it has.**
  `gh` is authenticated; `gh run list` shows 4 of 5 runs green including the
  latest, and run #6 was checked job by job (`check` 18s, `data` 27s).

### Standing rules that are easy to forget

- Run `make leakage` after **any** data change.
- Never regenerate a committed split. If one looks wrong, stop and ask.
- Every experiment needs a dumb baseline in the same table.
- Before every experiment: what is the current number, what is the dumb
  baseline, and what would make this experiment invalid?
